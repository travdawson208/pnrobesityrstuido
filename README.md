PnR Obesity - this was a project undertaken for my MPA program examining the effects of Parks and Recreation budgets on Obesity rates. 
The data was drawn from the Census, and the 2018 Country Health Rankings. Results show that increased Parks and Rec spending down have a positive
(lowering) effect on obesity rates, but not at a large enough rate to truly combat obesity.
